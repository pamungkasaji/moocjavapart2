PART 8
HashMap
    Typically, hash maps and lists are used together.
        The hash map provides quick access to a specific key or keys,
        while the list is used, for instance, to maintain order.
    System.nanoTime() method returns the time of the computer in nanoseconds
    DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) = code duplication should be avoided
    The hash map has a maximum of one value per key
        If a new key-value pair is added to the hash map, but the key has already been associated
        with some other value stored in the hash map, the old value will vanish from the hash map.

PART 9
Object polymorphism
    each variable can also be represented by the types of interfaces it implements and classes that it inherits
    If we only need methods defined in the Object class, such as toString, equals and hashCode in a method,
        we can simply use Object as the type of the method parameter
            public void printManyTimes(Object object, int times) { ... }

....

PART 10
Handling collections as streams
    Stream is a way of going through a collection of data such that the programmer determines the operation to be performed on each value
    With streams, the programmer defines a sequence of events that is executed for each value in a collection
    A stream does not change the values in the original data collection, but merely processes them
    stream() method can be called on any object that implements the Collection interface (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, ...)
    example stream method : mapToInt(value -> another)

Lambda Expressions
    anonymous methods that do not have an "owner", i.e., they are not part of a class or an interface
    The function contains both the parameter definition and the function body
    using lambda function as a parameter
        stream*.filter(value -> value > 5).*furtherAction*
        stream*.filter(value -> Screeners.greaterThanFive(value))
        stream*.filter(Screeners::greaterThanFive)
    variables declared outside of an anonymous function cannot be used

Stream Methods
    divided into two categories:
        (1) intermediate operations intended for processing elements
            Intermediate operations return a value that can be further processed
            method filter,  mapToInt
        (2) terminal operations that end the processing of elements
            returns a value to be processed
            method average

Terminal Operations
    - count method for counting the number of values
        .stream().count());
    - forEach method defines what is done to each list value
        .forEach(num -> System.out.println(num));
    - collect method for gathering the list values into another collection
        .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new));
    - reduce method for combining stream elements to some other form
        .reduce(0, (previousSum, value) -> previousSum + value);

Intermediate Operations
    Intermediate stream operations are methods that return a stream
    - map, converting a value from one form to another
    - filter, filtering values
    - distinct, identifying unique values
    - sorted, arranging values if possible

Objects and Stream
    books.stream()
        .map(book -> book.getAuthor())              //getAuthor() Author object
        .mapToInt(author -> author.getBirthYear())
        .average()

Files and Streams
    List<String> rows = new ArrayList<>();
    Files.lines(Paths.get("file.txt")).forEach(row -> rows.add(row));
        lines method throw exception

The Comparable Interface
    If a class implements the Comparable interface, objects from that class can be sorted using Java's sorting algorithms.
        public class Member implements Comparable<Member> { ... }
    compareTo method required by the Comparable interface
    objects of any class that implement the Comparable interface can be sorted using the sorted() method
    a stream does not sort the original list - only the items in the stream are sorted.
        to organize the original list, the sort method of the Collections class should be used

Sorting Method as a Lambda Expression
    Sorting a list WITHOUT having to implement the Comparable interface
    `sort` method of the `Collections` class and the stream's `sorted` method accept a lambda expression
        as a parameter that defines the sorting criteria
        Both methods can be provided with an object that implements the Comparator interface
            sort method = public static <T> void sort(List<T> list, Comparator<? super T> c)
                Collections.sort(persons, (p1, p2) -> p1.getBirthYear() - p2.getBirthYear());
            sorted method = Stream<T> sorted(Comparator<? super T> comparator)
                persons.stream().sorted((p1, p2) -> {
                    return p1.getBirthYear() - p2.getBirthYear(); });

Sorting By Multiple Criteria
    Comparator class provides two essential methods for sorting: comparing and thenComparing
    The comparing method is passed the value to be compared first, and the thenComparing method is the next value to be compared.
    thenComparing method can be used many times by chaining methods

PART 11
Class Diagram
    A class diagram describes classes and their attributes, constructors and methods as well as the connections between classes
    class diagram describes the structure of an object but not its functionality
    Connections between classes
        In a class diagram, the connections between classes are shown as arrows.
    Describing inheritance
        In a class diagram inheritance is described by an arrow with a triangle head
    Describing interfaces
        Implementing an interface is shown as a dashed arrow with a triangle arrowhead.

Package (Hampir sama seperti mooc oop 2013)
    it's wise to divide the classes into packages. Classes in one package might share funcionality, purpose, or some other logical property
    domain is often used to refer to the storage space of the classes that represent the concepts of the problem domain

Exceptions
    Handling exceptions
        use the try {} catch (Exception e) {} block structure to handle exceptions
    Exceptions and resources
        A resource is an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it, such as files
            try (Scanner reader = new Scanner(new File("file.txt"))) { ... }
        The try-with-resources approach is useful for handling resources, because the program closes the used resources automatically.
        If the resources are not closed, the operating system sees them as being in use until the program is closed.
    Shifting the responsibility
        Methods and constructors can throw exceptions
        We can handle exceptions by wrapping the code into a try-catch block or throwing them out of the method.
            public List<String> readLines(String fileName) throws Exception {
        Throws clause is used to declare an exception, which means it works similar to the try-catch block.
        throws keyword is in the function signature, followed by exception class
    Throwing exceptions
        The throw command throws an exception. Throw keyword is used inside a function, followed by instance
        throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
            throw new NumberFormatException();
        One exception that the user does not have to prepare for is IllegalArgumentException, It can be used when we want to ensure certain parameter values
            If an exception is a runtime exception, e.g. IllegalArgumentException, we do not have to warn about throwing it on the method declaration.
    Exceptions and Interfaces
        An Interface can have methods which throw an exception
            String load(String fileName) throws Exception;
        If an interface declares a throws Exception attribute to a method, the class implementing this interface must also have this attribute. However the class does not have to throw an error
    Details of the exception
        A catch block defines which exception to prepare for with catch (Exception e)
            The details of the exception are saved to the e variable.
            The Exception class has some useful methods. For example printStackTrace() shows how we ended up with an exception.
                We read a stack trace from the bottom up.
In Java, there are two types of exceptions:
    - Checked are the exceptions that are checked at compile time. Exceptions which must be handled
        These exceptions have to be prepared for with a try-catch block or by throwing them out of a method with a throws attribute in a method declaration.
        For example, exceptions related to handling files, including IOException and  FileNotFoundException
    - Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime
        They can be thrown during execution. These kinds of exceptions do not have to be handled with a try-catch block.
        In Java exceptions under Error and RuntimeException classes are unchecked exceptions
            IllegalArgumentException and NullPointerException are runtime exception
    Error, Error is irrecoverable e.g. OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.

Type parameters
    Generics relates to how classes that store objects can store objects of a freely chosen type
    ArrayList, for instance, receives a single type parameter, while HashMap receives two.
