WEEK 8
HashMap
    Typically, hash maps and lists are used together.
        The hash map provides quick access to a specific key or keys,
        while the list is used, for instance, to maintain order.
    System.nanoTime() method returns the time of the computer in nanoseconds
    DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) = code duplication should be avoided
    The hash map has a maximum of one value per key
        If a new key-value pair is added to the hash map, but the key has already been associated
        with some other value stored in the hash map, the old value will vanish from the hash map.
